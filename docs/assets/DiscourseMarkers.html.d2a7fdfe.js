Although they are similar, they are not the same. Cohesion relates to the micro level of the text, i.e. the words and sentences and how they join together. Coherence, in contrast, relates to the organisation and connection of ideas and whether they can be understood by the reader, and as such is concerned with the macro level features of a text, such as topic sentences, thesis statement, the summary in the concluding paragraph (dealt with in the essay structure section), and other &#39;bigger&#39; features including headings such as those used in reports.</p><p>When sentences, ideas, and details fit together clearly, readers can follow along easily, and the writing is coherent.</p><p>Discourse makers are words or phrases that are used to connect, orgnize, and manage sentences and paragraphs.</p><p>to help them seem clearer and more understandable.</p><p>They help join ideas and act as a connection or link between sentences and paragraphs.</p><p>Discourse makers have many functions. They can be used at the start, middle, or end of sentences and paragraphs. However, they are often used as sentence starters to link ideas and create fluency. Here are some examples for different functions.</p><p>//////////</p><p>Discourse markers are effective in both speeches as well as in writing. They help give a conversation or a piece of text a proper shape and assist in making it appear more fluent and logical. They allow the writer or speaker to use them as \u2018fillers\u2019.</p><p>///////////////////</p><p>Coherence is defined as the quality of being logical, consistent and able to be understood. Imagine coherence as a building (It\u2019s an analogy, go with it).</p><p>Cohesion on the other hand refers to the act of forming a whole unit. It is effectively a subset of coherence. Picture cohesion as the bricks and cement which make up the building.</p><p>Bricks and cement can be put together to create any form of structure. However, it is only when they are laid together properly that they form a building. Similarly, a text will be cohesive if cohesive ties are used however it will only be coherent if the cohesive ties are used appropriately to create meaning.</p><p>Language is a means of communication that helps people to express their ideas and opinions, understand what is going around them and share knowledge with others.</p><h2 id="discourse-and-discourse-markers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#discourse-and-discourse-markers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Discourse and Discourse Markers</h2><p>Discourse is a language spoken by human beings to communicate with each other or to debate. What makes a discourse different from random sentences is that the discourse has coherence. Hence, the ultimate goal of discourse is to send a message from the speaker to the hearer or from the writer to the reader. So, the hearer or the reader receives the message and upon this message he/she behaves and reacts. A single word as the imperative verb \u2018stop\u2019 can be considered as a discourse. But if the speaker needs to talk more than one sentence, he/she is forced to use discourse markers. Discourse markers are \u201Clinguistic, paralinguistic, or nonverbal elements that signal relations between units of talk by virtue of their syntactic and semantic properties and by virtue of their sequential relations as initial or terminal brackets demarcating discourse units\u201D. The speakers use DMs in their everyday discourse and dialogues. DMs are such as salt for food as discourse can\u2019t be considered as a discourse without DMs.</p><p>DMs have different level of semantic meaning and therefore they can signal a discourse relationship between sentences or signal attitudes of speakers or writers.</p><h2 id="coherence-cohesion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#coherence-cohesion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Coherence &amp; Cohesion</h2><p>Halliday and Hasan (1976) assume that coherence is a means that makes the sentences semantically well-formed.</p><p>The authors divide cohesion into two broad categories: grammatical cohesion referring to the structural content, and lexical cohesion referring to the language content of the piece. Under the first heading, they study the concepts of reference, substitution, ellipsis, and conjunction. Lexical cohesion, on the other hand, can occur in the form of reiteration or collocation.</p><p>V.

Lexical Cohesion lexical cohesion is the cohesive effect achieved by the selection of vocabulary.</p><p>lexical cohesion\u2019 can be achieved through several devices such as repetition, substitution, synonymy, antonym, and<br> hyponymy.. So, cohesion is partially expressed through using different types of vocabularies.</p><p>Repetition Synonymy<br> A. With identity of reference: Here, the lexical item refers back to the preceding one of the same entity. B. Without identity of reference: Hyponymy Meronomy Antonomy</p><p>VI.3. Collocation:</p><p>VI.3. Collocation: McCathy et al (2005) describes collocation as \u201C a natural combination of words; it refers to the way English words are closely associated with each other.\u201D (4). In other words, it is two or more than two lexical items that collocate with each other to produce new meaning.</p><p>VII. Written discourse and spoken discourse.</p><p>Also, there are two types of discourse: spoken and written discourse. Brown and Yule (1998) states that the speaker has voice effects such as facial expressions, postural and gestural systems which are called paralinguistic cues. So, these cues are different from one speaker to another but these cues are denied to the writer.</p><h2 id="what-is-cohesion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-cohesion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is cohesion?</h2><p>It is important for the parts of a written text to be connected together. Another word for this is cohesion. This word comes from the verb cohere, which means &#39;to stick together&#39;. Cohesion is therefore related to ensuring that the words and sentences you use stick together.</p><p>Good cohesion is achieved through the following five main methods, each of which is described in more detail below:</p><pre><code>repeated words/ideas
reference words
transition signals
substitution
ellipsis
Shell nouns

</code></pre><p>Repeated words/ideas infographic</p><p>Check out the cohesion infographic \xBB</p><p>One way to achieve cohesion is to repeat words, or to repeat ideas using different words (synonyms).</p><p>Reference words</p><p>Reference words are words which are used to refer to something which is mentioned elsewhere in the text, usually in a preceding sentence. The most common type is pronouns, such as &#39;it&#39; or &#39;this&#39; or &#39;these&#39;. Study the previous example again.
