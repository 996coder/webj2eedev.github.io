## 怎么练习?

The best way to overcome the IELTS speaking test, in my opinion, is to prepare your answer, or prepare the key words and expressions for every hot topic in advance. You can’t be expecting to improvise your answers unless you are the native speakers.

I believe that the IELTS speaking test part 1 and part 3 are more or less the same, which means you can have the same strategy to deal with, that is the ten different answer patterns; on the other hand, you’re supposed to prepare the part 2 according to your own experiences, I mean, you should write down your own answers and memorise them.
