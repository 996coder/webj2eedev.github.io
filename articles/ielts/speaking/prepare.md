### Tip 6: Avoid using fillers
Speak confidently and avoid using filler words. We generally use fillers when we don't know what to say, however, this shows the examiner that you can't access the appropriate language or ideas so it's important to avoid them and to use the phrases we gave you in Tip 5.

Avoid the following fillers:

* Like

* You know

* Umm...

* Ahh...

* Ehh...

* Well

* Yeah...

### Tip 7: Extend your answers
Try and answer the examiner's questions in full. Extend your answers and don't wait for the examiner to prompt you with a question. When your answers are short, this shows the examiner that you cannot talk in detail about a topic. If the examiner says 'Why?', they are prompting you to give a reason for your answer and to extend more fully.

### Part 1 —— Introduction

* **Listen to the tense** and make sure your answer matches the tense.

  * What do you study? - **Present** - I'm studying science at university.

  * What did you study? - **Past** - I studied science when I was at university.

  * What will you study? - **Future** - I'm planning to study science in the future.

* **Extend your responses to add some more information to your answer before the examiner asks 'why?'.**
  * What do you study? - Now - I'm studying science at university, because I have always wanted to be a scientist.

  * What did you study? - Past - I studied science when I was at university and now, I am preparing to do my doctorate.

  * What will you study? - Future - I'm planning to study science in the future, as I believe that scientists will help us deal with future environmental issues.

### Part 2 —— Long turn

* Use the 1 minute preparation time
  * Every task card will have a topic that you will have to describe followed by three bullet points, and a final question.
  * You should take notes on the three bullet points and on the final question.
  * A simple tip is to draw a cross on the piece of paper and take 4 sets of notes or to draw lines dividing your note paper into 4 columns. This will take about 4 seconds, so you have time to write some notes focusing on the question words on the task card

*  These tips will help you to sound more fluent as you are able to keep speaking in a logical way.

   * Use stalling phrases

   * **Refer directly to your task card - read out the prompt, changing the structure as you read it (and...what did I use it for, well, that's interesting, I actually used it for...)**

   * If the examiner is pausing and waiting for you to keep speaking, acknowledge that you still have more time left (Oh, I still have more time left! Well, to describe my piano in more detail, it is quite large and...)

   * If the examiner asks you if you have anything more to say, always say 'yes' and then continue speaking.

   * Avoid fillers (eh..., uh..., em..., er...) as they are meaningless and show that you are struggling to produce language and ideas.

   * Use hesitation devices to show that you can use a wider range of cohesive devicesand can think logically (well, let me think, let's see, it was a long time ago but..., another thing I remember about it was..., that reminds me about another time that I..).

   * Make sure you build your vocabulary using mind maps, so you can easily think of the right words to describe your topic.

* Individual Long turn Practice

  * Materials needed: Note paper, pencil, recorder and timer (mobile phone)

  * Choose one of the topics.

  * Set up your timer to time yourself for 3 minutes (1 minute preparation, 2 minutes long turn).

  * In the first minute, take notes on the topic.

  * Start your long turn on the second minute and see if you can keep speaking for 2 full minutes.

  * Listen to your recording and pay attention to breaks, pauses, hesitations and the use of fillers.

  * Repeat the process practising all 3 topics until you can speak at a normal rate for the full 2 minutes.

### Part 3 —— discussion

**In part 3, you are expected to discuss all topics in a general manner.** If you try and talk about yourself and your family, the examiner will steer you away from these familiar topics and will encourage you to speak in a general way. Remember that you have already talked about familiar topics in part 1 and part 2.

### Using discourse markers

* fluency and coherence
  * **Fluency** refers to your ability to keep speaking at a natural speech rate without pausing, repeating, or stopping for extended periods to think of what to say. 
  * On the other hand, **coherence** refers to how you organise and present your thoughts and ideas. 
    * Are you able to use appropriate discourse markers and linking phrases, 
    * and can you answer questions relevantly?

* What is a discourse marker?

  * Discourse markers are used to organise and manage what we are saying using words and phrases to connect ideas and to express how we feel about what we are saying. They are also used to help you think about what to say next using fillers correctly to sound natural in your delivery.
  * Discourse markers are used to express functions of speech and therefore help to organise what is said, while signalling the attitude of the speaker. 

* Which discourse marker to use and why?
  *  Sequencing - ordering information	
  *  Adding information	
  *  Indicating opinion & attitude
  *  Comparing	
  *  Contrasting
  *  Giving examples
  *  Stalling	
  *  Result
  *  Generalising

### functional language

* What is functional language?
  * functional language refers to words and phrases that we use to express a language function.
  * Functional language helps to communicate and organise your thoughts and ideas on a topic you are discussing as well as communicating how you feel about a particular topic.

* Talking about personal experiences
* Giving your opinion
* Speculating and talking about the future
* Agreeing and disagreeing
* Making comparisons and contrasting
* Asking the examiner for clarification
